# MatchTrackerApp

The goal of this project is to create an app for personnal use to help the user track his Magic:The Gathering matches. 
As the player will log in more matches, the application will provide statistics like win rates, number of game played with a given deck,
win rates against different archetype, etc, in the hope to give a little bit of insight to the player.

It is written in Java and I use SQLite to manage the database

I started to build this app last year when I started my programming degree and just had my introducory course to Java.

And now the more I learn about structure, architecture and clean code, the more I cringe when I come back to it.

Still, I want to finish it before I redesign it completely.
